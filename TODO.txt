TO DO:

Backend:
 * Clean up code, refactor etc.
 * More validation
 * Variable expiration times
    - Set a general lifecycle policy directly in S3?
 * Replace or wrap password hashing (currently just sha256). Bcrypt handles a
   maximum of 72 characters.
 * Multi-part uploads
    - Will make it easier to upload large files. Combine with some fancy
      javascript for showing progress bars etc. in the web interface

CLI:
 * Download: Append counter to filename if file already exists
 * Expiry dates do not appear to work for files uploaded from the CLI
